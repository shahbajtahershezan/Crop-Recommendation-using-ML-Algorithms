# Crop-Recommendation-using-ML-Algorithms
A machine learning-based crop recommendation system that predicts the most crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil parameters. This project compares multiple classification algorithms, including SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and ANN, to determine the optimal model for accurate crop prediction.
